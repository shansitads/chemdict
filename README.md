# chemdict

This is a fun-little side project that I did while experimenting with html, javascript and JSON.
The website allows the user to search chemistry related terms and returns the official IUPAC definitions.

### To be done :
- [x] Add featured terms
- [ ] Use a better search algorithm
- [ ] Try to make a separate file for JSON data
